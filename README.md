# Tackling Imbalanced Data with Predicted Probabilities
Classification algorithms are often able to output predicted probabilities. These predicted probabilities provide an additional model-tuning mechanism that could help boost prediction performance on imbalanced data.Â 

This article discusses the differences in predicted probabilities across five machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Classification and XG Boost. It demonstrates how predicted probabilities may be used to improve these models' performance in a case study. The case study is the 2014 Portuguese bank marketing dataset, where the target variable is successful subscriptions to a term deposit.
